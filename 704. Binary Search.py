"""
Time complexity: O(logn)
nums is divided into half each time. In the worst-case scenario, we need to cut nums until the range has no element, and it takes logarithmic time to reach this break condition.
Space complexity: O(1)

704. Binary Search
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.
